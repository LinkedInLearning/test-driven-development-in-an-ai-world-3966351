Implement a new feature using Test-Driven Development (TDD) in React.

Begin by writing a failing test that defines the expected behavior using Vitest and React Testing Library.

Include key test cases with clear, specific assertions.

Then:

Write the minimal code required to make the test pass.

Prioritize readability and use React hooks where appropriate.

Ensure all tests pass.

Add comments to explain your implementation choices and any adjustments made.
