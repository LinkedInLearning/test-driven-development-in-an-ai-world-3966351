# Feature Request: Tourist Destinations Search Bar

## Overview
Users need an intuitive way to discover tourist destinations that match their personal preferences and travel criteria. Currently, users must browse through all available destinations without filtering capabilities, making it difficult to find relevant options for their specific needs.

## User Context
**As a** travel enthusiast planning my next trip  
**I want** to search for tourist destinations using specific criteria  
**So that** I can quickly find destinations that match my interests, budget, and travel preferences without having to scroll through irrelevant options.

### User Scenarios
- A budget traveler wants to find destinations under $100/day
- An adventure seeker looks for destinations with hiking and outdoor activities
- A family searches for child-friendly destinations with specific amenities
- A user wants to find destinations in a particular region or climate

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `api/destinations/search`
- **Method**: GET with query parameters
- **Expected Response**: JSON array of destination objects matching search criteria

### Search Capabilities
The search functionality should support multiple criteria types:
- **Text search**: Destination names, descriptions, and location keywords
- **Category filters**: Adventure, family-friendly, cultural, beach, mountain, etc.
- **Price range**: Daily budget filters
- **Geographic filters**: Country, region, or proximity-based search
- **Activity types**: Specific activities available at destinations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **AC1**: Search bar is prominently displayed on the destinations page when it loads
- [ ] **AC2**: Text input field accepts alphanumeric characters and common punctuation
- [ ] **AC3**: Search is triggered when user presses Enter or clicks search button
- [ ] **AC4**: Search is triggered automatically after 500ms of user inactivity (debounced)
- [ ] **AC5**: Search results are displayed below the search bar within 2 seconds of query submission

### Search Behavior
- [ ] **AC6**: Empty search query returns all available destinations
- [ ] **AC7**: Search is case-insensitive and trims whitespace
- [ ] **AC8**: Partial matches are supported (e.g., "par" matches "Paris")
- [ ] **AC9**: Search persists in URL parameters for shareable links
- [ ] **AC10**: Previous search query is retained when user navigates back to the page

### API Integration
- [ ] **AC11**: Search requests are sent to `api/destinations/search` endpoint with query parameter
- [ ] **AC12**: Loading indicator is shown during API requests
- [ ] **AC13**: API errors display user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **AC14**: Network timeout after 5 seconds with retry option
- [ ] **AC15**: Search results are cached for 5 minutes to improve performance

### User Experience
- [ ] **AC16**: Search input has placeholder text: "Search destinations by name, location, or activity..."
- [ ] **AC17**: Clear button (X) appears when text is entered to reset search
- [ ] **AC18**: Search suggestions appear after typing 2+ characters (if API supports autocomplete)
- [ ] **AC19**: "No results found" message displays when search returns empty results
- [ ] **AC20**: Search result count is displayed (e.g., "Found 23 destinations")

### Accessibility
- [ ] **AC21**: Search input has proper ARIA labels and is keyboard navigable
- [ ] **AC22**: Screen readers can announce search results count
- [ ] **AC23**: Focus management works correctly when navigating with keyboard
- [ ] **AC24**: Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Performance & Technical
- [ ] **AC25**: Search input is responsive and works on mobile devices (min width 320px)
- [ ] **AC26**: Component renders without JavaScript for basic functionality
- [ ] **AC27**: Search history is stored locally (last 5 searches) for user convenience
- [ ] **AC28**: Input validation prevents XSS attacks and malicious queries
